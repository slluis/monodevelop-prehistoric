//Notes for parser tests
BaseAccess -- "base.a" gets a parse error, how do I get it?
BaseIndexerAccess -- "base[a]" gets a parse error, how do I get it?
BoxedCast -- not implemented, but not sure how to test parser to get one
ComposedCast -- what is this?
EmptyCast -- what is this?
SizeOf -- "sizeof(a)" gets a parse error, how do I get it?
This -- "this" gets a parse error, how do I get it?
TypeOf -- "typeof(a)" gets a parse error, how do I get it?
Unary -- what is the operator "TOP", from Unary.UnaryOperator enum?
UnboxCast -- how do I get one?


Goto -- Why three constructors?  why a "string ident" and an expression?
Switch -- "switch (a) {}" gives a parse error... shouldn't.
Try -- "try {;} catch {;}" gets error "Object reference not set to instance of an object" in yyparse()
UsingStatement -- parser returns 'null' for the statement value no matter what the input

no "bad inputs" tested

-------------------------------NOTES FOR DENNIS

processCType(CType) inside InterpretationVisitor--test it
forAs() branch of InterpretationVisitor not implemented?


is 'blah == blah' supposed to call the .Equals() method??  Thought it was a reference thing?

Easy way to instantiate a user/non-primitive class?

Need to test the Binary AST!

in Binary's arithmetic, a right shift is interpretted as a left shift-- get Dennis to fix

env.AddUsingAlias("alias2","System.Reflection");  this throws a missingtypeornamespace exception

line 229 InterpretationVisitor
Field/Property 

Multi-dimensional elementaccess doesn't work?  Tried to make a new array a[5][5], then tried the
expression "a[4][4] = 56", got an error saying that the rank of the elementaccess wasn't equal to the 
rank of the actual array.  Check whole unit test for that

"Item" is what?  What's the second main branch?  confusing
