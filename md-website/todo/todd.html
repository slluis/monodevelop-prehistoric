    <h1>Todd's MonoDevelop Todo List</h1>

    <p>Here is a list of stuff that is on my todo list for MD. Some of these
      are huge, others are smaller. All of them need to get done and I will 
      be implementing them over time. They are not listed in any
      particular order at all. And if anyone starts to implement one and
      wants my help, or just wants to do it on their own, and submits
      patch(es) for them I won't be offended. I promise. If you have
      any questions regarding this list, email either the
      <a href="mailto:monodevelop-list@lists.ximian.com">list</a> or
      <a href="mailto:tberman@off.net">me directly</a>.</p>

    <h2>Updating/Extension system</h2>

    <p>To prevent MD from turning into a hugely bloated pile of features that
      no one uses, we need to create a system that allows extensions to be
      installed with a minimum of fuss.</p>

    <p>My current thinking is that the MD core should be light, potentially
      lighter than it is now. However, due to the way most people install MD
      requiring installation into its prefix (generally /usr) would be
      impossible to handle reliably. So, what we need to do, is allow
      ~/.local/share/monodevelop/ to become an overridable mirror of
      $prefix/lib/monodevelop/ (which should in reality move to
      $prefix/share/monodevelop/). This will allow the gui to install/manage
      extensions installed into that location. RPM packages of various
      extensions would still be possible, as they would be installed
      system-wide into $prefix/lib/monodevelop.</p>

    <p>General feature requirements of this system:
      <ul><li>Installation of extensions, hopefully via the web w/ some
	sort of web services/xml fetching system.</li>
      <li>Removal of extensions.</li>
      <li>Enabling/Disabling of various extensions without removal.</li>
      <li>Updating of extensions.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>A couple potential potholes in implementing this:
      <ul><li>API changes between various versions of MonoDevelop. There will
	have to be a way for the extensions to say 'I work on version 0.7 and
	0.8'.</li>
      <li>Proper handling of updating, basically, when MonoDevelop 0.9 comes
	out, do we enable extensions that arent certified to work with 0.9 and
	take our chances, or do we disable functionality until someone marks
	that extension as 'working'?</li>
      <li>Dependency resolution. Both MD Extension deps and external deps.</li>
      <li>It would be entirely possible for one
	extension to conflict with another, and this needs to be avoided,
	as it could break one, or both of the extensions. Having a variable
	like 'importance' is not the way to go, as then you will end up
	with every extension marked as the highest importance level
	available.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Keybinding System</h2>

    <p>Currently, we have hardcoded keybindings, like control+space to
      trigger code completion, or F1 to do monodoc lookups. This needs to
      be moved to a system that allows arbitrary keybindings to be assigned
      to the keys.</p>

    <p>Looking at the gnome-control-center keybinding capplet for a UI
      would be a good place to start, however also need a way for extensions
      to install keybindings onto the system so they show up there.</p>

    <h2>Menu Extensibility</h2>

    <p>Our menu system is very extensible as it stands right now. However,
      there are a few key places where more extensibility is needed. One
      is in the right click menu on the text widget. This is an area that
      sorely needs fixing for future text widget features.</p>

    <p>Another place that could be useful is customized menus. Right now
      you can change the menu easily by editing the xml that represents
      them. However, it would be nice to be able to do this via a gui.
      Many people may disagree with allowing this sort of configurability, and
      at times, I do as well, however it will allow people to work faster,
      and that is the prime goal of the IDE. As well as disabling/enabling and
      rearranging menu items, it would be nice if you could change the accel
      the menuitem is attached to.</p>

    <h2>Code Templating Updates</h2>

    <p>Our code template system now is just no good. typing forp and having
      it expand into a for loop just isnt as helpful as typing for and hitting
      tab, and getting an expanded for loop, potentially even with more hinting
      occuring. A system that allowed you to define variables that would be
      expanded is the way to go. For example, a template defined as:<br/></p>

    <div class="code-csharp">
for ($type$ $variable$ = 0; $variable$ &lt; | ; $variable$++)<br/>
{<br/>
<br/>
}</div>

    <p>Would allow you to hit tab and switch between the various variables, and
      when you changed one instance, it would change them all. Note, this is just
      an example off the top of my head, and the final syntax would be totally
      different.</p>

    <h2>Code Completion</h2>

    <h3>Overloads</h3>
    
    <p>Overloads need to be listed in the main dropdown, sequentially. So
      for Console.WriteLine it should have:<br></p>

    <div class="code-csharp">
WriteLine (int value)<br/>
WriteLine (bool value)<br/>
etc..</div>

    <p>This will allow for a lot greater flexibility, as well as allow the
      different overloads (which could have different docs) to show up
      properly without someone guessing.</p>

    <h3>Method Insight</h3>

    <p>When you enter the ( to start a method, it needs to id the method
      you are working with, and display a parameter list as well as any
      additional info it might have (docs, etc). In addition, if the method
      has no overloads, or you just chose a specific overload in the previous
      completion dialog, it should attempt to help you out, by displaying
      a completion list with all the matching types. If you didn't pick
      an overload from this list, it should show all types that match that
      parameter from all the available overloads.</p>

    <h3>Additional completion targets</h3>

    <p>Here is a small list of additional places where code completion
      isnt, and could be.</p>

    <ul><li>override methods. When you type 'public override' you have just
	limited your available potential entries, we should offer completion
	data there.</li>
      <li>There are more, I'm just drawing a blank right now.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Debugger GUI</h2>

    <p>The debugger doesnt have nearly enough gui, at all. This needs to be
      fixed. This has to wait until the debugger is relatively stable API-wise
      and usable.</p>

    <h2>Assembly Browser</h2>

    <p>We need a plugin that can load .exe and .dll files, and introspect
      against them. Something similar to reflector, or what #D currently
      has. Eventually, this should show the il for the various members,
      and give you all kinds of good info.</p>

    <h2>Revision Control Integration</h2>

    <p>We need to integrate with various revision control systems.
      The ideal solution for this would be one revision control plugin that
      accepts various providers. However, since we are in the real world, this
      is not something that will likely be feasible, as revision control
      systems often have completely different feature sets. Initially at the
      very least, we need to attempt to support SVN (sorry cvs users, but
      we use SVN, so its the #1 priority for us).</p>

    <h2>Gtk# GUI Designer</h2>

    <p>This topic could fill volumes, but will get a mention here, with an
      eventual link to more information.</p>

    <h2>Property Grid Control</h2>

    <p>Needed for the TODO item above, however we also need it outside of
      that. This control is essential in the long term for MD and for any
      Gtk# GUI Designer.</p>

    <h2>ASP.NET Support</h2>

    <p>ASP.NET Support is similar to the Gtk# GUI Designer. It is a huge huge
      item to support, and to do it properly, we will need to push together
      more code than any single other piece. A link when there is more info
      anywhere will be put here.</p>
