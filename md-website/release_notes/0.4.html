    <h1>MonoDevelop 0.4</h1>
    
    <p><a href="http://www.monodevelop.com">MonoDevelop</a> 0.4 has been
      released. MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and
      other .NET languages. You can always find current info 
      <a href="http://www.monodevelop.com/">here</a>. There is also a nice 
      tutorial <a href="http://www.monodevelop.com/tutorial.aspx">here</a>.
      
    </p>

    <h2>Installing MonoDevelop</h2>
    
    <h3>Getting setup</h3>
    
    <p>You can get detailed instructions on how to build MonoDevelop 0.4 from <a href="http://www.monodevelop.com/tutorials/package_install.aspx">here</a>.</p>
    
    <p>You can download MonoDevelop 0.4 source from <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/beta2/monodevelop-0.4.tar.gz">here</a>. The <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">go-mono</a> site contains packages for everything for
    many popular distros. You can also check the mono redcarpet channel.</p>
    
    <h2>New Features</h2>
    
    <h3>Monodoc Integration</h3>
    
    <p>F1 now attempts to identify what type and method you are working
      with and pull up Monodoc documentation for it. This is very beta, and
      not completed functionality yet. Look for vast improvements in
      the next version of MonoDevelop.</p>
    
    <h3>Code Completion</h3>
    
    <p>In addition to numerous bugfixes in general, Lluis Sanchez (of mono's
      remoting and web services fame) has rewritten the code completion
      backend and given us amazing speed and memory improvements.</p>

    <p>Here is a brief rundown of the improvements this patch gives us:</p>

    <p>We no longer require the generated code completion database at first
      run. Assemblys that are not part of the older database used to be
      reindexed at project load every time. They are now serialized.
      MonoDevelop projects now save a up to date completion database instead
      of requiring all their files to be parsed every time. The databases
      are updated as assemblies change. Our memory footprint is far smaller
      and the startup time has been reduced. And last but not least, we now
      load the class browser on demand instead of all at once. There are
      more changes, but those are the high points. All in all, it is a far
      more usable setup.</p>
    
    <h3>Nautilus integration</h3>
    
    <p>Drag and Drop from nautilus (and other text/uri-list providers) is now
      supported.</p>
    
    <h3>Generation of makefiles</h3>
    
    <p>The makefile generation support that was beta in 0.3 has been greatly
      improved in 0.4. It is now able to handle most projects and will not
      interfere with existing automake builds. These makefiles are also
      now autogenerated at the appropriate times. By default, in MonoDevelop,
      the old build system is still being used.</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <h3>New reference information</h3>
    
    <p>In order to work properly with the GAC, when loading an old project for
      the first time under MonoDevelop 0.4, you will have to remove and readd
      all of your references. Until you do so, many pieces of MonoDevelop
      will not function correctly.</p>
