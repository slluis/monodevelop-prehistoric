This list tracks know issues, hopefully to prevent duplicate bug reporting
upon release.

* When you iconify a dockitem, close MonoDevelop and reopen, the dockitem is
  gone.
* When you maximize MonoDevelop, the docks do not resize properly.
* The toolbar sometimes exhibit interesting behaviour including but not
  limited to looking disabled and working, looking enabled and not working
  and others.
