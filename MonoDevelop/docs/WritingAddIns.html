    <title>Writing an addin for MonoDevelop</title>
  <head>
  <body>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>MonoDevelop (and SharpDevelop) have been written so that they
    can be easily extended by others.  This can be accomplished by doing
	two simple things. First, by creating an assembly (dll) containing
	the code for your addin.  Second, providing an .addin XML file that
    maps your code into MonoDevelop.  There is a detailed pdf available
    at SharpDevelop's website <a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/TechNotes/ProgramArchitecture.pdf">here</a> that you will want to read for a 
    full understanding of the entire system and possiblities.  This is
    intended as a simple and quick overview.</p>

	<h3>Terms</h3>
	<p><b>AddIn</b> - what many other systems refer to as a plugin. In this case the whole application is also a plugin<br />
	<b>Pad</b> - content area like the project browser or output pad. <br />
	<b>View</b> - main content area, like the SourceEditor.<br />
	<b>Language binding</b> - compilation, execution, and project management for a programming language<br />
	<b>Service</b> - reponsible for one part of the program, for example the MessageService is delegated the reponsiblity of displaying messages to the user.
    </p>

    <h3>AddIn assembly</h3>
	<p>In your code you can extend the IDE at pretty much any point.
	Some common things would be to extend the menus, pads, views,
    services, commands, etc.  I recommend looking at src/AddIns/ for a
	few examples.  In most cases you will simply inherit from an
	abstract class or implement an interface for the various parts you
	are extending. For example, a new service could be defined as:</p>
    <code>
<pre>
using System;
using MonoDevelop.Core.Services;

namespace MonoDevelop.Services;
{
	public class ExampleService : AbstractService
	{
		// Do stuff here
	}
}
</pre>
    </code>
<p>Here is a list of some of the common classes to extend for an AddIn:
<pre>
./src/Main/Base/Gui/Dialogs/AbstractOptionPanel.cs
./src/Main/Base/Gui/Dialogs/Wizard/AbstractWizardPanel.cs
./src/Main/Base/Gui/Pads/ClassScout/BrowserNode/AbstractClassScoutNode.cs
./src/Main/Base/Gui/Pads/ProjectBrowser/BrowserNode/AbstractBrowserNode.cs
./src/Main/Base/Gui/AbstractBaseViewContent.cs
./src/Main/Base/Gui/AbstractPadContent.cs
./src/Main/Base/Gui/AbstractViewContent.cs
./src/Main/Base/Gui/AbstractSecondaryViewContent.cs
</pre>
</p>

    <h3>.addin.xml file</h3>
	<p><b>Note:</b> MonoDevelop had to change to .addin.xml extension for
	using gettext in translations.  SharpDevelop uses .addin</p>
    <p>The addin file basically maps the "entry" points of your code
	into the various parts of the IDE.  You specify services to load,
    append menus in a certain place, and virtually everything else.
	Since the entire application is an AddIn there is no limit.
    It supports conditional directives and other advanced constructs.
    In the following sample MonoDevelopNunit.addin.xml file, you can see
	it specifies the name of the assembly to load, specifies a service
    to load into the /Workspace/Services node, two views and some menus.
    Last, it is important to note the class attribute that is used to
    specify the type to instantiate for that part of the AddIn.</p>
	<xmp>
<AddIn name      = "MonoDevelop Nunit"
       author    = "John Luke"
       copyright = "GPL"
       url       = "http://monodevelop.com"
       description = "NUnit testing tool"
       version   = "0.2">
 
        <Runtime>
                <Import assembly="MonoDevelop.Nunit.dll"/>
        </Runtime>
 
        <Extension path="/Workspace/Services">
                <Class id = "NunitService"
                    class = "MonoDevelop.Services.NunitService"/>
        </Extension>
 
        <Extension path="/SharpDevelop/Workbench/Views">
                <Class id    = "NunitTestTree"
                       class = "MonoDevelop.Nunit.Gui.TestTree"/>
                <Class id    = "NunitResultTree"
                       class = "MonoDevelop.Nunit.Gui.ResultTree"/>
        </Extension>
 
        <Extension path="/SharpDevelop/Workbench/MainMenu/Tools">
                <MenuItem id = "NunitMenu" label = "NUnit" insertafter = "ExternalTools" insertbefore = "Options">
                        <MenuItem id = "LoadTestAssembly"
                          label = "Load Assembly"
                                  shortcut = ""
                              class = "MonoDevelop.Commands.NunitLoadAssembly" />
                        <MenuItem id = "NunitRunTests"
                          label = "Run Tests"
                                  shortcut = ""
                              class = "MonoDevelop.Commands.NunitRunTests" />
                </MenuItem>
        </Extension>
</AddIn>
	</xmp>

	<h3>AddIn tree</h3>
	<p>The various addins are loaded and merge into an AddInTree, which
	is how the IDE knows what and where to load</p>

    <h3>AddIn xml format</h3>
	<p>There is an AddIn.xsd file that specifies the required/optional
	xml format. Perhaps someone would like to make a RelaxNG one also.
	See <code>data/resources/AddIn.xsd</code></p>

    <h3>Building and installing</h3>
    <p>We currently support both running in a self-contained <code>build/</code>
    directory as well as installing to <code>$(prefix)/lib/monodevelop</code> so you
    will want to make sure both your .addin.xml file and .dll are placed
    into the AddIn directory in both places.  <b>Note:</b> this this may change
    at some point in the future.</p>

	<h3>Existing Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li>SourceEditor</li>
  <li>CSharpBinding</li>
  <li>JavaBinding</li>
  <li>NemerleBinding</li>
  <li>DebuggerAddin</li>
  <li>Monodoc</li>
  <li>StartPage (not fully ported)</li>
  <li>NUnit (incomplete)</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Caveats</h3>
    <p>Although SharpDevelop and MonoDevelop currently use the same
    format this may not always be the case.  Also, while non-gui addins
    could possibly be reused, MonoDevelop and SharpDevelop use different
    GUI toolkits that will likely prevent sharing many things. Any
	suggestions on making sharing things as easy as possible would be
	appreciated.</p>

    <h3>AddIn ideas</h3>
    <p>There are various things that would be nice to have implemented
    as addins.  Here is a brief list of the top of my head.
<ul>
  <li>A viewer for the mono profiler (mono --profile) and mono coverage tools.</li>
  <li>Extra languages/compilers support.</li>
  <li>NUnit and NAnt integration tools.</li>
  <li>Glade (although a new GUI designer is planned).</li>
  <li>Integration with Subversion, CVS, and other version control tools.</li>
  <li>UML/CASE tools.</li>
  <li>SQL/Database support.</li>
  <li>An advanced XML editor.</li>
  <li>Also, there are some additional things that SharpDevelop already has that could be ported to MonoDevelop.</li>
</ul></p>
