MonoDevelop supports the Java langauge by using IKVM (http://www.ikvm.net/)
To use it you need to do the following.

Install at least the following
mono
mono-ikvm
ikvm

The following assumes mono and ikvm are installed in
/usr and you have permission to write to /usr/lib).

Use ikvmstub to produce stub .jar files from .NET assemblies
to be used when compiling with a java compiler.
ex. ikvmstub /usr/lib/mscorlib.dll

Do this for every assembly you will be accessing from java and
remember to include them in your classpath.

Start MonoDevelop
Create a new Ikvm Console Project
Verify your project classpath is correct by:
  right clicking on the project
  select project options
  under Configurations, Debug, Code Generation
ex. usr/lib/mscorlib.jar:.

Add Ikvm.GNU.Classpath.dll and Ikvm.Runtime.dll as project references

compile and run
