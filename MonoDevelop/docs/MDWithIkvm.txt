MonoDevelop supports the Java language by using IKVM (http://www.ikvm.net/)
Currently this is a bit of a manual process. In the future, I
hope to do this all automatically. See the TODO file in
Extras/JavaBinding for more information.

To use it you need to do the following.

Install at least the following
mono
mono-ikvm
ikvm

run ./configure --enable-java=yes
(until autodetection of ikvm is added)

The following assumes mono and ikvm are installed in
/usr and you have permission to write to /usr/lib).

Use ikvmstub to produce stub .jar files from .NET assemblies
to be used when compiling with a java compiler.
ex. ikvmstub /usr/lib/mscorlib.dll

Do this for every assembly you will be accessing from java and
remember to include them in your classpath.

Start MonoDevelop
Create a new Ikvm Console Project
Verify your project classpath is correct by:
  right clicking on the project
  select project options
  under Configurations, Debug, Code Generation
ex. usr/lib/mscorlib.jar:.

Add IKVM.GNU.Classpath.dll and IKVM.Runtime.dll as references

compile and run
