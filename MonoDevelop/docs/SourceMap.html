    <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Sometimes it can be hard to find your way around the MonoDevelop
	source tree.  This is intended as a brief description on where and
	what things are, and a couple tips to find things.</p>
    <h3>Terms</h3>
	<p>AddIn - similar to a plugin<br />
	Service - provides widgets, events, etc. to the various other parts<br />
	Codon -<br />
	Command -<br />
	Pads -<br />
	Wizard -<br />
	OptionPanel -<br /> 
	View -<br /> 
	</p>
    <h3>Map</h3>
	<p>MonoDevelop.Core - contains the bare necessities for the IDE.  It
	has no external dependencies and is located at <code>src/Libraries/MonoDevelop.Core/</code></p>
	<p>MonoDevelop.Base - contains the base of the IDE.  It begins to
	depend on Gtk/GNOME at this point and is located at <code>src/Main/Base/</code></p>
	<p>AddIns - various plugins that add to the IDE's functionality are
	located at <code>src/AddIns/</code> See also the AddIns guide.</p>
	<h3>Last resort</h3>
	<p>Sometimes its still can be confusing so running something like
	the two below commands can be used as a last resort to find things.
	</p><p>
	<code>find . -name '*TypeName*.cs'</code>
	</p><p>
	<code>find . -name '*.cs' | xargs grep TypeName</code>
	</p>
