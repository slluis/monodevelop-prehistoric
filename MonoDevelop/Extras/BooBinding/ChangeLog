	* Gui/BooShellModel.boo: Don't join the aborted
	thread. This isn't needed, and hangs mono-1.1.7 and
	newer.

2005-05-03  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* BooShell/BooShell.boo: Make sure we don't get
	disposed prematurely.

2005-05-02  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Remoting/*:
	* Gui/BooShellModel.boo:
	* BooShell/BooShell.boo:
	* Makefile.am: Switch over to using the new
	RemoteProcessObject API. Removes the need for
	all of BooShell.Remoting, and simplifies things
	elsewhere.

2005-05-02  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Gui/BooShellModel.boo: Fix from lluis to make
	MD not crash when right clicking the shell with
	no projects open.

2005-05-02  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>
	
	* BooShell/BooShell.boo: Convert to using Monitor instead
	of just lock(), prevents the 100% utilization by mono
	as reported by several folks.
	* Gui/BooShellModel.boo: Some Monitor fixes, and a small
	fix to make pasted input with multiple lines get processed
	properly.

	* Makefile.am: added missing dependency for target $(ASSEMBLY)

2005-04-25  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* BooShellServer/BooShellServer.boo:
	Small fix to make sure the shell server
	doesn't exit unexpectedly.

2005-04-25  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Properties/GeneralShellProperties.boo:
	* Gui/*: Lots of changes to handle new shell
	handling, as well as adding the ability to
	load the assemblies generated by the currently
	open solution/combine.
	* Remoting/*: Library for doing remoting
	using unix sockets
	* BooShell/BooShell.boo: New shell object
	created out of process from MD for projection
	* BooShellServer/BooShellServer.boo: Remoting
	server for serving up the BooShell objects
