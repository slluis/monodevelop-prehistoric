	* BooBindingCompilerServices.boo: Make sure we
	only generate the assembly in the file, not
	loaded into memory.

2005-05-30  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Parser/TypeMembers.boo: Cleanup, and add handling
	of get/set for properties properly.
	* Parser/Visitor.boo: Handling of get/set for properties,
	move to using FullName where appropriate for class members,
	and set enum return types to null.

2005-05-30  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Parser/Visitor.boo: Only abort parsing on parser
	errors. We may have type binding errors that should be
	ignored, since we do the resolving of those ourselves.
	* Parser/TypeMembers.boo: Constructors should have a fully
	qualified name of 'ctor', not '#ctor'.
	* Parser/Resolver.boo: Fix problem with 'super' not always
	finding the super class.
	
2005-05-29  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* BooBindingCompilerServices.boo: Redo most of the
	compiler stuff to use the Boo API instead of calling
	out to booc in a seperate process. Is faster, and removes
	the gross regexes previously used to parse errors.

2005-05-27  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Parser/*: Various cleanups of print statements,
	as well as various fixes to improve resolution of
	fields and local variables.

2005-05-24  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Parser/BooParser.boo: One small fix to return
	a new CompilationUnit instead of null in case
	of a failed parse attempt.

2005-05-24  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Parser/Visitor.boo: Cull out compiler
	generated fields, and note if errors occured
	before this visitor and return immediate if so.
	* Parser/BooParser.boo: Keep a cache of successful
	parser results, and return those for any files that
	error out due to syntax errors, etc.

2005-05-22  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Parser/Resolver.boo: More cleanups,
	and make static/non-static member showing work
	properly.

2005-05-22  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Parser/BooParser.boo:
	* Parser/Resolver.boo: Various small cleanups
	* Parser/Visitor.boo: Some small cleanups, and parse
	events now as well.

2005-05-21  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* BooShellPadContent.cs: Make the pad placement
	easier to find when first viewing the shell.

2005-05-21  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Parser/BooParser.boo: Move filename assignment to
	after parsing is complete. Makes the class browser (mostly)
	work now.

2005-05-19  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* BooBinding.mp{p,s}:
	* BooShell/BooShell.mp{p,s}:
	Add project files for compiling the BooBinding using MD.

2005-05-10  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Gui/ShellTextView.boo: Use a normal StreamWriter
	instead of the Boo.IO stuff, since Boo.IO has moved
	in current Boo SVN to Boo.Lang.IO

2005-05-04  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* BooShell/BooShell.boo: Make sure we 
	dispose of the worker thread.

2005-05-04  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Gui/BooShellModel.boo: Don't join the aborted
	thread. This isn't needed, and hangs mono-1.1.7 and
	newer.

2005-05-03  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* BooShell/BooShell.boo: Make sure we don't get
	disposed prematurely.

2005-05-02  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Remoting/*:
	* Gui/BooShellModel.boo:
	* BooShell/BooShell.boo:
	* Makefile.am: Switch over to using the new
	RemoteProcessObject API. Removes the need for
	all of BooShell.Remoting, and simplifies things
	elsewhere.

2005-05-02  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Gui/BooShellModel.boo: Fix from lluis to make
	MD not crash when right clicking the shell with
	no projects open.

2005-05-02  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>
	
	* BooShell/BooShell.boo: Convert to using Monitor instead
	of just lock(), prevents the 100% utilization by mono
	as reported by several folks.
	* Gui/BooShellModel.boo: Some Monitor fixes, and a small
	fix to make pasted input with multiple lines get processed
	properly.

2005-04-28  Rafael Monoman Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: added missing dependency for target $(ASSEMBLY)

2005-04-25  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* BooShellServer/BooShellServer.boo:
	Small fix to make sure the shell server
	doesn't exit unexpectedly.

2005-04-25  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Properties/GeneralShellProperties.boo:
	* Gui/*: Lots of changes to handle new shell
	handling, as well as adding the ability to
	load the assemblies generated by the currently
	open solution/combine.
	* Remoting/*: Library for doing remoting
	using unix sockets
	* BooShell/BooShell.boo: New shell object
	created out of process from MD for projection
	* BooShellServer/BooShellServer.boo: Remoting
	server for serving up the BooShell objects

2005-04-25  Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org>

	* Initial import of the Boo addin.
