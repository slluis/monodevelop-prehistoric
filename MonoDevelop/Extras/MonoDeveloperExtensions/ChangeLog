	* MonoProject.cs: Look for ChangeLog files in a more rational 
	(and faster) way.

	* MonoProject.cs: Update the sources file when files are renamed.
	Don't add the ChangeLog file to the project for now, it's too slow
	to look for it.

	* MonoProject.cs: Don't try to parse errors from the stdout, only
	from stderr.
	* MonoMakefileFormat.cs: In GetValidFormatName, keep the file path.
