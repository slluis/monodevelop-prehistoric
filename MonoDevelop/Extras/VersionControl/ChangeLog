	* AddIn/Statuses.cs,Logs.cs: Some widgets needed
	  to be shown since MD is calling Show() less.
	* VersionControl/Subversion.cs: Not all entries
	  returned by svn have a URL, e.g. obstructed entries.
	  So don't rely on that to get the local path.

	* AddIn/Makefile.am: Was broken since last time
	  it was changed.

	* Added MD solution files for VersionControl.
	* Project pad overlays now update when files
	  are modified.
	* Project pad context menus enabled for
	  folders and combines.
	* Subversion: Don't report diffs available
	  for unchanged files.
	* This was committed with the addin!

	* Added VersionControl into repo (but sadly the addin
	  cannot add itself into the repo yet!).
