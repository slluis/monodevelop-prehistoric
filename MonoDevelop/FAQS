- Why do I get "** ERROR **: Must shutdown ORB from main thread"
  when exiting MonoDevelop?

There was a bug in ORBit2 2.8.2 and lower.  Please upgrade ORBit2
if you do not want to see this error anymore.

- Why aren't my C# files syntax highlighted?

GNOME doesn't recognize *.cs files as the text/x-csharp
mimetype.  gtksourceview-sharp tries to set this up automatically,
but it may not work in all cases. You can use 
gnome-file-types-properties to do this.

- What if the configuration summary says 'no' for one of the
  requirements?

The configure script uses pkg-config to see if you have the 
required packages to build.  If it can't detect a package that
you have installed:
	
add the path to the <package>.pc file to PKG_CONFIG_PATH
ex. export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH	

install a newer version or the development counterpart
of that package and rerun ./configure
ex. gnome-vfs2-devel-2.4.1-1.rpm

- Is there anonymous access to the source?

Yes, via snapshots at http://devservices.go-mono.com/MonoDevelop/
Hopefully now that subversion is 1.0 we will get our anonymous
mirror of the repository up and going again.

- How do I rebuild the Code Completion database?

You can either remove the database itself or remove the
reference to its location in the config file
ex. rm ~/.config/MonoDevelop/CodeCompletionData/*.bin
ex. edit ~/.config/MonoDevelop/MonoDevelopProperties.xml and
remove the SharpDevelop.CodeCompletion.DataDirectory node
