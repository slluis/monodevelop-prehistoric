~ Run/Compile single source files/projects
~ SearchManager stuff (find, replace, etc)
~ CodeComplete generation exit and reload cleanly
~ Parser segfault in complex files gone
~ Figure out why the code completion works on unsaved files to a point, and
  what exactly #D does with unsaved files (need someone with windows to play
  around)
