Here is the short list of features to finish before the preview release
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

~ Scouts
~ Docking Manager
~ Run/Compile single source files/projects
~ SearchManager stuff (find, replace, etc)
~ CodeComplete generation exit and reload cleanly
~ Parser segfault in complex files gone
~ Figure out why the code completion works on unsaved files to a point, and
  what exactly #D does with unsaved files (need someone with windows to play
  around)
~ Finish HtmlControl
~ Why the hell is new file showing up as Ctrl+O?!?
~ Revert back to the old popup mechanism (immediate) and have an option
  'autopopup on/off' to control if it comes up or requires a ctrl+space to popup
