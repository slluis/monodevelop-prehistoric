This is a port of SharpDevelop to Gtk# and Mono.

Compiling and running
---------------------
To compile run the following command:

make

If you do not have pkg-config set up right, you will need to
set PREFIX to the prefix that Gtk# is installed in.

To run MonoDevelop:
./monodevelop

Example:
make clean && make && ./monodevelop

Dependencies
------------
Mono >= 0.30 with ICU enabled
Gtk# cvs
ORBit2 >= 2.8.3
gtksourceview >= 0.7
gtksourceview-sharp from mono's cvs
(gtksourceview is available on Red Carpet,
on many of the OpenCarpet channels.)

See http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/monodevelop-list/2004-January/000129.html.

The .cs extension must be mapped to the mime type text/x-csharp for the new editor to work.
You can use gnome-file-types-properties to do this.
