This is a port of SharpDevelop to Gtk# and Mono.

Compiling and running
---------------------
To compile run the following command:

make

If you do not have pkg-config set up right, you will need to
set PREFIX to the prefix that Gtk# is installed in.

To run MonoDevelop:
./monodevelop

Example:
make clean && make && ./monodevelop

Dependencies
------------
You need Mono and Gtk# cvs, and ORBit2-2.8.3 or newer

Mono must be installed with ICU enabled.
