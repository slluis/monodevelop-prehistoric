This is a port of the #Develop editor widget to Gtk#/Mono.
To compile simply run make, or 'make run' to compile and run it.
You need Mono 0.29 and Gtk# cvs.

Very under development

The SharpDevelop folder is a 098source unzip.

The src folder is our modified sources
We are attempting to follow as CLOSE as possible the #D directory structure.

We are also attempting to minimize repeated sources by building as much as 
possible out of the source files in the SharpDevelop folder, for an example, 
look at the src/Libraries/SharpAssembly/Makefile
