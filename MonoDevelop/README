This is a port of SharpDevelop to Gtk# and Mono.

Compiling and running
---------------------
To compile run the following command:

./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local
make

(you need to pass the prefix where gtk# is located)

To run MonoDevelop:
make run

Example:
make clean && make && make run

Installing
----------
make install

Dependencies
------------
Mono >= 0.30 with ICU enabled
Gtk# cvs
ORBit2 >= 2.8.3
gnome-vfs >= 2.0
gtksourceview >= 0.7
gtksourceview-sharp from mono's cvs
(gtksourceview is available on Red Carpet,
on many of the OpenCarpet channels.)

See http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/monodevelop-list/2004-January/000129.html.

The .cs extension must be mapped to the mime type text/x-csharp for the new editor to work.
You can use gnome-file-types-properties to do this.
