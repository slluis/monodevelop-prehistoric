This is a port of SharpDevelop to Gtk# and Mono.
To compile simply run make, or 'make run' to compile and run it.
You need Mono and Gtk# cvs.

You will also need GtkMozEmbed# installed.  If you do not have a recent version. Do this once:
cd ./gtkmozembed-sharp && ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local && make && make install

(replace /usr/local with the same prefix as the rest of Gtk#)

Mono must be installed with ICU enabled.
