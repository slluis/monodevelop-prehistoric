This is a port of SharpDevelop to Gtk# and Mono.

To compile run the following command:
make PREFIX=/usr/local

(change /usr/local to the prefix Gtk# is installed to)

To run MonoDevelop:
./monodevelop

EXAMPLE:
make clean && make PREFIX=/usr && ./monodevelop

You need Mono and Gtk# cvs, and ORBit2-2.8.3 or newer

Mono must be installed with ICU enabled.

We are attempting to follow the HIG in certain areas especially, particularly dialogs.
