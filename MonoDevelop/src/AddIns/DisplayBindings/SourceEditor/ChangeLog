	* Gui/SourceEditorView.cs: insert the character, *then* start the code
	completion window, this results in the code completion window showing

	* CodeCompletion/CompletionWindow.cs: only UnselectAll when you have
	a better option, otherwise stay where you are.

	* CodeCompletion/CompletionWindow.cs: add proper checking on when
	to close the window based on backspacing.
