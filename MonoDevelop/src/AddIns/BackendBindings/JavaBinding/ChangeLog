	* JavaBindingCompilerService.cs: account for classpath when compiling
	* Gui/ProjectConfigurationPropertyPanel.cs: rough port, needs major HIG love
	* JavaBindingExecutionService.cs: use ikvm instead of java runtime
	* Parser/*: make a copy of the CSharpBinding/Parser in case I am crazy enough
	to port the parser to work with Java (not built yet)

	import from SD and make it build with our
	namespaces and SourceEditor
	change to work like CSharpBinding
