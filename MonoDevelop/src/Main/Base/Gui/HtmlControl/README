This is intended to provide a cross-platform HTML
displaying Gtk# widget.  Currently it is display only,
but may someday be used as part of ASP.NET ide support.

To add support for a platform or Html Renderer:
1) class must be able to be packed into a Gtk.Frame
2) implement IWebBrowser interface

for example:

MozillaControl : GtkMozEmbed.EmbedWidget, IWebBrowser
