2004-05-26  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Gui/Dialogs/ReferenceDialog/SelectReferenceDialog.cs: fix up
	per edd's suggestions. Now we select a valid node if possible when
	you remove, and the remove button is only sensitive when an iter is
	selected.

2004-05-26  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Services/ProjectService/DefaultProjectService.cs: move the call to
	GenerateMakefiles when the solution is closed to somewhere that
	actually generates a makefile.

2004-05-26  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Internal/Project/Combine/Combine.cs: actually tested with a solution
	with 2 projects in it, one that references the other. It works now,
	building, cleaning, running, etc.
	* Internal/Templates/ProjectTemplates/CombineDescriptor.cs: setup
	OutputDirectory properly by default.

2004-05-26  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	make.sh.

	a *strange* nullref that keeps popping up.

2004-05-26  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@ximian.com>

	* Services/ParserService/DefaultParserService.cs: Type names for fields,
	  parameters, base classes and so on come unresolved from the parser
	  (without namespace information). They must be resolved before adding them
	  to the database. This is done through the method ResolveTypes.
	* CodeCompletionDatabase.cs: Resolve type names before adding the class to
	  the database.
	* PersistentIndexer.cs, PersistentParameter.cs, PersistentMethod.cs,
	  PersistentReturnType.cs, PersistentEvent.cs, PersistentField.cs,
	  PersistentProperty.cs, PersistentClass.cs: Added method for resolving
	  the type names.

	  completion database.
	  
	* Services/File/DefaultFileService.cs: In LoadFileWrapper, use IProject
	  reference instead of project name.
	
	* Services/Project/DefaultProjectService.cs: Added ReferenceAddedToProject
	  and ReferenceRemovedFromProject events. Changed how event are handled.
	  Now the service just forwards the events received from the open combine.

	  provide information about the source project in the args.
	  
	* Services/Project/IProjectService.cs: Added new reference events.
	
	* ParserService/DefaultParserService.cs: Mostly reimplemented. The new

	* Services/ParserService/IParserService.cs: Added IProject parameter to

	  the project, but it is loaded under demand as project nodes are expanded.
	  
	* Gui/Pads/ClassScout/NodeBuilder/IClassScoutNodeBuilder.cs: Use a single
	  method to update the tree from parse event args.
	  
	* Gui/Pads/ProjectBrowser/BrowserNode/ProjectBrowserNode.cs,
	  Gui/Pads/ProjectBrowser/BrowserNode/CombineBrowserNode.cs:
	  Use Combine.RemoveEntry to remove projects from a combine.
	  
	* Gui/AbstractViewContent.cs: Implement new Project property.
	
	* Makefile.am: Added new files: 
	  Services/ParserService/CodeCompletionDatabase.cs,

	  Internal/Project/Project/ProjectReferenceEventArgs.cs,
	  Internal/Project/Project/ProjectFileEventArgs.cs,
	  Internal/Project/Combine/CombineEntryEventArgs.cs.
	  
	* Internal/Project/Project/IProject.cs: Added new events for changes in
	  files and references.

	  Internal/Parser/PersistenceLayer/PersistentProperty.cs,
	  Internal/Parser/PersistenceLayer/PersistentClass.cs,
	  New implementation of read and write methods based on static methods. In
	  this way it can be used to write instances of any IClass and not only
	  PersistentClass. Also use new helper methods for writing strings and
	  object references.
	  
	* Internal/Parser/IClass.cs: Moved ClassInheritanceTree to IParserService.
	
	* Internal/Parser/ReflectionLayer/ReflectionClass.cs: Added Null check for

2004-05-01  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Gui/Pads/OpenTaskView.cs: Fix gtk+2.4 regression.
	* Services/ParserService/DefaultParserService.cs: load assemblies
	out of the GAC for indexing.

2004-04-30  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Gui/Pads/HelpBrowser/MonodocTreePad.cs: Hide doc nodes without
	any docs. This is an ugly ugly solution, but it works. Feel free
	to replace it with something better that looks nice.

2004-04-29  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Services/ParserService/DefaultParserService.cs: commenting out
	a GC.Collect () per lluis' instructions, this results in monodevelops

	from cvs.
	* Gui/Dialogs/ReferenceDialog/SelectReferenceDialog.cs:
	* Gui/Dialogs/ReferenceDialog/GacReferencePanel.cs:
	Now we actually pull assemblies from the gac.
	NOTE: Until gtk-sharp, and other libraries actually start using the gac
	it will not be possible to add a proper gac reference to them.
	This will be fixed on their end by beta1 however.

2004-04-28  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Commands/RunCommands.c:
	* Services/Project/DefaultProjectService.cs: 
	* Services/Project/IProjectService.cs:

	* Internal/Project/Project/IncludeFilesDialog.cs:
	* Internal/Project/Combine/Combine.cs:
	* Internal/Project/Combine/CombineEntry.cs:

	Commit basically sets up the skeleton for the GenerateMakefiles stuff.
	Right now all the real code is in the LanguageBinding, where it
	should be (I think). Anyone looking to add this functionality to their
	LanguageBinding is welcome too, however the api and setup may change
	while the C# implementation is being written, so there are no
	promises at all.


2004-04-27  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	when you render new docs.

	* Services/ParserService/AssemblyInformation.cs: match api.
	* Internal/Parser/ReflectionLayer/Reflection*.cs:
	Add the start of documentation integration into the actual IDE.
	Now the docs show up on code completion tooltips, just the summary.
	Potentially we should enable the entire doc for the class/method,
	but I havnt seen how it looks yet, as it will most likely be large
	for some methods/classes.

	**NOTE: To get this documentation integration, you have to rebuild
	your code completion database.

2004-04-17  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Services/Toolbar/ToolbarService.cs:
	* Gui/Workbench/Layouts/SdiWorkspaceLayout.cs:
	* Gui/Workbench/DefaultWorkbench.cs:
	* Gui/Components/SdToolbarCommand.cs:
	Fixup the entire toolbar scheme to actually *work* properly.
	This is only temporary, as the entire toolbar setup is going to be
	rewritten again to support arbitrary widgetry, proper saving/loading of
	toolbars tied to layouts, etc, etc.

2004-04-17  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Gui/Components/SdMenu.cs:
	* Commands/MenuItemBuilders.cs:
	Fix the menu system so we dont rebuild the menu's from scratch every
	time you use them. This should speed using the menu's up a lot.
	The only trick is new SubmenuItemBuilders need to create menu types
	with the ISubmenuItem interface so we can tell that they are built
	and not static.
