- Test the functionality of the CreateCombineDialog vs the #D on Windows
- Get code-folding working (it's only drawn, at the moment). It seems not
  being implemented in the original #d, though.
- Implement various menu items
- Port dialogs to Gtk# (Please keep it as #D of a way as possible)
- Convert all the icon code to Pixbuf instead of System.Drawing stuff (mostly done, I think)
- HtmlControl (jluke)
- Implement the remaining Option Dialogs. The framework is already ported (jba).
- After the project pad is ported, we need to write a new Docker widget thing.
  more docs later. Have to change the implementation of the docking manager.
  Currently is a rough non-docking implementation in the file
  src/Main/Base/Gui/Workbench/Layouts/DockingManager.cs, wich can be used as a
  template for a more advanced one.
- Project pad doesnt show extensions when the option is selected
- Project pad doesnt update when the option is changed (Most likely code in
  multiple places)
- Implement binding with monodoc to allow InsightWindow to work properly (jluke)
- Implement Help Scout (jluke/others)
- Tie Help Scout to monodoc (jluke)
- When too many tabs are opened they go out for the window and don't show
- cross platform printing support (check AbiWord for ideas maybe)
- HIGify (or at least improve the look) of dialogs
	http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/
- some keywords should be bold when highlighted
- make fonts choice persist (after restarting)

---- Bugs in the File->New->File... Dialog

- It doesnt save settings like the #D one (last category/template). (Blair)
- Anything that triggers a Wizard does *not* work until the wizard is fixed.

---- Bugs in Code Completion --- There are a lot, so only the big ones for now.

- Is enabled and it shouldnt be until the file is saved so we have an extension.
- Backspace doesnt work? why? (it's catched by KeyReleaseEvent, instead of 
  Press, I don't know why we don't catch the Press event)
- Lots more...
