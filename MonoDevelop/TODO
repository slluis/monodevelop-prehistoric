  more docs later. Have to change the implementation of the docking manager.
  Currently is a rough non-docking implementation in the file
  src/Main/Base/Gui/Workbench/Layouts/DockingManager.cs, wich can be used as a
  template for a more advanced one.
  multiple places)
- Implement binding with monodoc to allow InsightWindow to work properly (jluke)

---- Bugs in the File->New->File... Dialog

- It doesnt save settings like the #D one (last category/template). (Blair)
- Anything that triggers a Wizard does *not* work until the wizard is fixed.

---- Bugs in Code Completion --- There are a lot, so only the big ones for now.

- Is enabled and it shouldnt be until the file is saved so we have an extension.
- Backspace doesnt work? why? (it's catched by KeyReleaseEvent, instead of 
  Press, I don't know why we don't catch the Press event)
- Lots more...
