MonoDevelop supports the Java langauge by using IKVM which is distributed
with mono.  To use it you need to do the following.

Install at least the following
mono
mono-ikvm
ikvm

(Assume prefix=/usr and permission to write to /usr/lib)
cd /usr/lib
ikvmstub /usr/lib/mscorlib.dll
ikvmstub (other assemblies you will use)
ex. /usr/lib/mono/gtk-sharp/gtk-sharp.dll

run MonoDevelop
new Console Java Project
verify Classpath is correct for the project by:
  right clicking on project
  project options
  under Configurations, Debug, Code Generation
ex. usr/lib/mscorlib.jar:.
compile and run
see "Hello World"

Thats it.
