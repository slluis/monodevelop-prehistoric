* MonoDevelop Roadmap
* Draft -- Wednesday January 21st

** Short term (next 4 months) goals

	*** Complete the porting of #D to MonoDevelop

	*** Merge changes to the #D codebase to MonoDevelop (always ongoing)

	*** Move to a new build system, this one wont properly support
	    everything we need (easy .desktop integration, etc).

	*** We need to finish off porting everything in sight, and some more
	    pieces that are yet not in sight.
	
	*** Determine what direction to take asp.net and gtk# gui design
	    in. Potentially as a first step for asp.net design time
	    support, we can attempt to do some basic html design goodness.

	*** Enhance our xml editing capabilities.

	*** Bug fixing, lots of it, as well as further integration with 
	    the GNOME desktop.

** Longer term goals

	*** Continue GNOME desktop integration.

	*** Finish off asp.net and gtk# gui design.
