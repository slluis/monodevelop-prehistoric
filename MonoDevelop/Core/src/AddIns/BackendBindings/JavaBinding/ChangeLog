	* *.cs: cleanup everything
	remove single file compile/run
	remove runtime choices and use ikvmc to produce assemblies

	need to check errors on ikvmc part, I wish there was a better
	way than screen-scraping to do this.

	convert line endings to unix, not sure why they were dos style

	* JavaBindingCompilerService.cs: rework so Process.Start works
	* JavaBindingExecutionService.cs: rework so Process.Start works

	add support for using Gij
	* Gui/ProjectConfigurationPropertyPanel.cs:
	enable Java, remove Mono, and add Gij runtimes
	* JavaRuntime.cs: add Gij

	* JavaBindingCompilerService.cs:
	rework error parsing to work off of Streams instead of temp files

	set the column of the error
	specify the output directory
	* Project/JavaCompilerOptions: add runtime prop

	for choosing runtime

	* JavaRuntime.cs: add enums for compiler and runtime

	* JavaBindingCompilerService.cs: account for classpath when compiling,
	work with gcj or javac, cleanup old code
	* Gui/ProjectConfigurationPropertyPanel.cs: rough port, needs major HIG love,
	cleanup, add RadioButtons to select from gcj and javac
	* JavaBindingExecutionService.cs: use ikvm instead of java runtime
	* Parser/*: make a copy of the CSharpBinding/Parser in case I am crazy enough
	to port the parser to work with Java (not built yet)
	* Project/JavaCompilerParameters.cs: add javac/gcj .Compiler property,
	fix CompilerPath from being hardcoded

	import from SD and make it build with our
	namespaces and SourceEditor
	change to work like CSharpBinding
