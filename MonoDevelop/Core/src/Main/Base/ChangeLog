2004-05-30  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@ximian.com>

	* Services/ParserService/DefaultParserService.cs: Don't use the "Gac:"
	  prefix to reference gac assemblies, they are handled internally by
	  AssemblyCodeCompletionDatabase.
	  When locating an assembly database, take into account partial names,
	  and avoid loading the same db twice.
	  Perform the modified file check taking into account dependencies
	  between databases. This increases the posibility of resolving all classes
	  of a database in the first parse cycle (since its dependecies will be
	  already parsed).
	  Added parameter to GetClass which allows deep search of a class in all
	  project references.
	  In ResolveTypes, added out parameter to inform if all types could be
	  resolved.
	  In ClassInheritanceEnumerator, use a reference deep search to get base
	  classes.
	  
	* IParserService.cs: Added parameter to GetClass which allows deep search of
	  a class in all project references.
	  
	* CodeCompletionDatabase.cs: Increased db version, since the format has
	  changed a bit. Added an easy way for derived classes to serialize data
	  together with the index.
	  When writing the db, make a byte copy from the old file to the new one
	  for classes not loaded.
	  In ProjectCodeCompletionDatabase, if a file can't be fully resolved,
	  schedule a reparse.
	  In GetClass() support lookup of inner classes. Improved some internal
	  methods to support this.

2004-05-29  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Services/ProjectService/DefaultProjectService.cs: move the call to

	building, cleaning, running, etc.

	OutputDirectory properly by default.

	* Services/ParserService/DefaultParserService.cs: Type names for fields,
	  parameters, base classes and so on come unresolved from the parser
	  (without namespace information). They must be resolved before adding them

	  the database.
	* PersistentIndexer.cs, PersistentParameter.cs, PersistentMethod.cs,
	  PersistentReturnType.cs, PersistentEvent.cs, PersistentField.cs,

	  and ReferenceRemovedFromProject events. Changed how event are handled.
	  Now the service just forwards the events received from the open combine.

	  provide information about the source project in the args.
	  
	* Services/Project/IProjectService.cs: Added new reference events.

	  method to update the tree from parse event args.
	  
	* Gui/Pads/ProjectBrowser/BrowserNode/ProjectBrowserNode.cs,
	  Gui/Pads/ProjectBrowser/BrowserNode/CombineBrowserNode.cs:
	  Use Combine.RemoveEntry to remove projects from a combine.
	  
	* Gui/AbstractViewContent.cs: Implement new Project property.
	
	* Makefile.am: Added new files: 
	  Services/ParserService/CodeCompletionDatabase.cs,

	  Internal/Project/Project/ProjectReferenceEventArgs.cs,
	  Internal/Project/Project/ProjectFileEventArgs.cs,
	  Internal/Project/Combine/CombineEntryEventArgs.cs.

	  Internal/Parser/PersistenceLayer/PersistentProperty.cs,
	  Internal/Parser/PersistenceLayer/PersistentClass.cs,
	  New implementation of read and write methods based on static methods. In
	  this way it can be used to write instances of any IClass and not only
	  PersistentClass. Also use new helper methods for writing strings and
	  object references.
	  
	* Internal/Parser/IClass.cs: Moved ClassInheritanceTree to IParserService.

2004-05-01  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Gui/Pads/OpenTaskView.cs: Fix gtk+2.4 regression.
	* Services/ParserService/DefaultParserService.cs: load assemblies
	out of the GAC for indexing.

2004-04-30  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Gui/Pads/HelpBrowser/MonodocTreePad.cs: Hide doc nodes without
	any docs. This is an ugly ugly solution, but it works. Feel free
	to replace it with something better that looks nice.

2004-04-29  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Services/ParserService/DefaultParserService.cs: commenting out
	a GC.Collect () per lluis' instructions, this results in monodevelops

	from cvs.
	* Gui/Dialogs/ReferenceDialog/SelectReferenceDialog.cs:
	* Gui/Dialogs/ReferenceDialog/GacReferencePanel.cs:
	Now we actually pull assemblies from the gac.
	NOTE: Until gtk-sharp, and other libraries actually start using the gac

	This will be fixed on their end by beta1 however.

2004-04-28  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Internal/Project/Project/IncludeFilesDialog.cs:
	* Internal/Project/Combine/Combine.cs:
	* Internal/Project/Combine/CombineEntry.cs:

	Commit basically sets up the skeleton for the GenerateMakefiles stuff.
	Right now all the real code is in the LanguageBinding, where it
	should be (I think). Anyone looking to add this functionality to their
	LanguageBinding is welcome too, however the api and setup may change
	while the C# implementation is being written, so there are no
	promises at all.


2004-04-27  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Gui/Pads/HelpBrowser/MonodocTreePad.cs: Select the content window
	when you render new docs.

	* Internal/Parser/ReflectionLayer/Reflection*.cs:
	Add the start of documentation integration into the actual IDE.
	Now the docs show up on code completion tooltips, just the summary.
	Potentially we should enable the entire doc for the class/method,
	but I havnt seen how it looks yet, as it will most likely be large
	for some methods/classes.

	**NOTE: To get this documentation integration, you have to rebuild
	your code completion database.

2004-04-17  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Services/Toolbar/ToolbarService.cs:
	* Gui/Workbench/Layouts/SdiWorkspaceLayout.cs:
	* Gui/Workbench/DefaultWorkbench.cs:
	* Gui/Components/SdToolbarCommand.cs:
	Fixup the entire toolbar scheme to actually *work* properly.

	toolbars tied to layouts, etc, etc.

2004-04-17  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Gui/Components/SdMenu.cs:
	* Commands/MenuItemBuilders.cs:
	Fix the menu system so we dont rebuild the menu's from scratch every
	time you use them. This should speed using the menu's up a lot.
	The only trick is new SubmenuItemBuilders need to create menu types
	with the ISubmenuItem interface so we can tell that they are built
	and not static.
